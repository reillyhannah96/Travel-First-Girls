<h2>Introduction</h2>   
<p> Chile extends travellers an invitation that is hard to turn down. From the driest desert in the world up north to eternal glaciers and inverted waterfalls down south. Situated along the western seaboard of South America, 
    Chile follows on from its boundary with Peru, to the tip of South America at Cape Horn, 
    only about 400 miles north of Antarctica. Boasting one of the more urbanised Latin American societies,
    and a democratic government, you can feel genuinely safe while getting to grips with its diverse people and geography!  </p>
    <main>
        <div id="What to See"></div>
        <h2>What To See</h2>
<p>Here are the top five places to visit in Chile:</p>
<p><strong>1. Santiago-</strong> The Capital. Surrounded by the Andes mountains, 
                                 Santiago has to be one of the most beautiful capital cities on the planet. 
                                 It’s also a very fun place to visit, with a rich history, vibrant culture, and great tourism infrastructure</p>
<p><strong>2. Rapa Nui - AKA - Easter island -</strong> Discover the mysterious culture of the Rapa Nui people and the iconic moai statues.
                                                        While most people visit Rapa Nui to explore its cultural history the island is also home to some excellent diving, 
                                                        surfing, and enticing beaches when a bit of relaxation is in order.</p>
<p><strong>3. San Pedro De Atacama -</strong>  an age-old town with dirt roads and adobe homes. Here you can explore the arts and crafts centre of Chile
                                               by day and by night gaze at the endless amounts of stars twinkling across the sky of the driest desert in the world. </p>
<p><strong>4. Torres del Paine National Park - </strong>a vast national park not far from Patagonia. The jaw-dropping landscapes of this eighth wonder of the world could keep you busy for months! 
                                                        At this national park you can sail on Lake Grey to admire the eponymous glacier, or paddle a kayak through its colossal blue and white icebergs.</p>
<p><strong>5. Chiloé -</strong> an extraordinary island full of myths and legends, unique folklore and culinary traditions. Made famous by its quaint palafitos – colourful houses built on stilts above the water, 
    and the island’s striking landscapes. Visiting Chiloé is like entering a magical world blessed in nature and culture. From the moment you first set foot on this extraordinary island, 
    its singular identity will take you by surprise. </p>

<div>
<div id="Transport">    
<h2>Transport</h2>
<p>It is relatively easy to travel around Chile. Buses are now the main means of long distance transportation in Chile, 
    following the decline of the rail network. The bus system covers the whole country, from Arica to Santiago 
    (a 30-hour journey) and from Santiago to Punta Arenas (about 40 hours, with a change at Osorno).  </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Buses:  Chile's biggest bus company is TurBus, with an all-embracing network of services around the country. There is also Pullman.</li>
        <li>Cars: Automóvil Club de Chile (rentals) </li>
        <li>Planes: Chile has several domestic airlines. LATAM has the most routes. Sky Airlines, LAW and JetSmart are other options.</li>
    </ul>

<div>
<div id="Where to stay">    
<h2>Where To Stay</h2>
<p>Chile boasts troves of fantastic places to stay, whether in the grand metropolis of Santiago, or in shadow of the andes.
     The majority of these are safe and friendly. The costs of rooms depends on the type of hotel or hostel and what extra features you would like, 
     including how much privacy you’re hoping for.</p>

<div>
<div id="Language tips">    
<h2>Language Tips</h2>
<p>Spanish is the official language and it spoken by all Chileans. There are, however, other languages or dialects still used by indigenous communities of the country. 
    Spanish was inherited from the Spanish Conquistadores, but throughout the years phonetic, syntactic, and lexical traits have allowed a new Chilean Spanish to develop. 
</p>
</p>
</div>

<h3>Some Spanish phrases:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>¡Hola! – Hello </li>
    <li>¿Cómo estás? – How are you? </li>
    <li>Por favor – please </li>
    <li>Gracias – thank you </li>
    <li>¿Dónde está la calle [de Alcalá]? – Where is [Alcalá] Street? </li>
    <li> Estoy perdido – I’m lost </li>
    <li>¿Dónde puedo encontrar un taxi?– Where can I get a taxi? </li>
    <li>¿Cuánto cuesta? – How much is it? </li>
    <li>La cuenta, por favor – The bill, please. </li>
</ul>
<div> <p>
    <h3>Some "Chilean-isms":</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>¿Cachai? – you know?/you got it? </li>
        <li>Po – used after si and no</li>

    </ul>
</div>

<div>
<div id="Safety">    
<h2>Safety</h2>
<p>According to the Safe Cities Index, recently prepared by The Economist, Santiago is the safest city in Latin America. 
    Meanwhile, a worldwide study prepared by Newsweek rates Chile as the best country in Latin America to live.
    When visiting, it is important to look after your bags/suitcases to avoid theft.
    Make sure to carry copies of all your important documents, including the address of where you are staying. 
    Make sure to stay with people during the evenings, and avoid walking home alone at night. 
    Chile is a land of extreme natural events: volcanic eruptions, violent earthquakes, and tsunamis often beset the country.
     Fierce winter storms and flash floods alternate with severe summer droughts. When planning your trip, check which season is best to travel to your planned regions.
