            <p> 
                From the driest desert in the world up north to eternal glaciers and 
                inverted waterfalls down south, Chile extends travellers an invitation 
                that is hard to turn down. Situated along the western seaboard of South America, 
                Chile extends from its boundary with Peru, to the tip of South America at Cape Horn, 
                only about 400 miles north of Antarctica. Boasting one of the more urbanised Latin American societies,
                and a democratic government, you can feel truly safe whilst getting to grips with its diverse people 
                and geography!  
            </p>
            <h2> What to see:</h2>
            <p> Here are the top five places to visit in Chile:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Santiago - The Capital. Surrounded by the Andes mountains, 
                    Santiago has to be one of the most beautiful capital cities on the planet. 
                    It’s also a very fun place to visit, with a rich history, vibrant culture, and great tourism infrastructure.</li>
                <li>Rapa Nui - AKA - Easter island. Discover the mysterious culture of the Rapa Nui people and the iconic moai statues.
                    While most people visit Rapa Nui to explore its cultural history the island is also home to some excellent diving, 
                    surfing, and enticing beaches when a bit of relaxation is in order</li>
                <li>San Pedro De Atacama - an age-old town with dirt roads and adobe homes. Here you can explore the arts and crafts centre of Chile
                     by day and by night gaze at the endless amounts of stars twinkling across the sky of the driest desert in the world. </li>
                <li>Torres del Paine National Park - a vast national park not far from Patagonia. The jaw-dropping landscapes of this eighth wonder of the world could keep you busy for months! 
                    At this national park you can sail on Lake Grey to admire the eponymous glacier, or paddle a kayak through its colossal blue and white icebergs.</li>  
                <li>Chiloé- an extraordinary island full of myths and legends, unique folklore and culinary traditions. Made famous by its quaint palafitos – colourful houses built on stilts above the water, 
                    and the island’s striking landscapes. Visiting Chiloé is like entering a magical world blessed in nature and culture. From the moment you first set foot on this extraordinary island, 
                    its singular identity will take you by surprise.</li>

            (a 30-hour journey) and from Santiago to Punta Arenas (about 40 hours, with a change at Osorno).  </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Buses:  Chile's biggest bus company is TurBus, with an all-embracing network of services around the country. There is also Pullman.</li>
                <li>Cars: Automóvil Club de Chile (rentals) </li>
                <li>Planes: Chile has several domestic airlines. LATAM has the most routes. Sky Airlines, LAW and JetSmart are other options.</li>

            <h2>Language Tips:</h2>

                Spanish was inherited from the Spanish Conquistadores, but throughout the years phonetic, syntactic, and lexical traits have allowed a new Chilean Spanish to develop. 
            </p>

            <h2>Safety tips:</h2>
            <p>According to the Safe Cities Index, recently prepared by The Economist, Santiago is the safest city in Latin America. 
                Meanwhile, a worldwide study prepared by Newsweek rates Chile as the best country in Latin America to live.
                When visiting, it is important to look after your bags/suitcases to avoid theft.
                Make sure to carry copies of all your important documents, including the address of where you are staying. 
                Make sure to stay with people during the evenings, and avoid walking home alone at night. 
                Chile is a land of extreme natural events: volcanic eruptions, violent earthquakes, and tsunamis often beset the country.
                 Fierce winter storms and flash floods alternate with severe summer droughts. When planning your trip, check which season is best to travel to your planned regions.
